# Roadmap
We cite here some interesting capabilities that are missing today:

  - **Ephimeral log**. When you use Kwirth for alerting, you don't need in fact to store all the messages, you just want to receive them, process thwm and show alerts if something happens, but you don't really want to store all the messages that you are not interested in.
