# Roadmap
We cite here some interesting capabilities that are missing today:

  - **Ephimeral log**. When you use Kwirth for aalerting, you don't need in fact to store all the messages, you just want to receive them , process tehm and show alerts if something happens, but you don't need to store all the messages that you are not interested in.
