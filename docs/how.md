# How it works
Basically, Kwirth receives logs form one or more Kubernetes clusters in real-time, and with the data received you can do several thinks depending on your role.

  - Kwirth can be used on Operations areas for detecting exceiotioonal situations.
  - It can also be used by development teams for reviewing logs of the services deployed to the cluster.
  - A Security team (a SOC) can also configure alerts on messages received from the source logs.
