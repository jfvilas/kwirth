# Kwirth security
Thera exist three kinds of security that must be taken into account:

  1. Administrators security.
  2. User security.
  3. API security.


### Administrator security
When you first deploy Kwirth there will exist an admin account. The credentials for the admin account are strong credentilas like these:

  - User: admin
  - Password: password

The first time you access Kwrith you must use the admin credentilas, and Kwirth will force you to change the password. You cannot continue the login process without changing the password.

The admin is the only user who can perform security related activities, like creating other users or managing API keys for enabling access to Kwirth from otrher Kwirth fontal apps.

### User security
You can create, modify and delete users using "User security" menu option from the main Kwirth menu. If you are not an admin user you will not see this option.

### API security
You can create, modify and delete API keys using "API security" menu option from the main Kwirth menu. If you are not an admin user you will not see this option.
