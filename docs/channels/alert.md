# Alert channel
Alert channel si a subtype of Log Channel that can be used to rise alerts on onformation received on logs (in real-time, of course).

## What for
You can configure an alert channel for detecting log messages from objects in scope that match som specific regex. Alert channel is designed to work with three standard severity levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR) and inform th euser when a message has been produced that matches any of the severity levels configured.

You can add, for example, a tab containing all the namespaces in your cluster, so you can detect veeery easily when an ERROR occurs anywhere. Please rememeber the way tbas change its colour when new data is received, so a owrking alrt tab will move form green to yellow if a new alert is received (as weel as it occurs with other channels, for sure).
